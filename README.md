# Shuttr

[Live Link](https://shuttr.herokuapp.com/)

Shuttr is a photo sharing website inspired by [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/). It has Rails/PostgreSQL as its backend frameworks, and React.js and Redux as its frontend frameworks.

Shuttr was designed and implemented within a 10-day timeframe. Regardless, this is still an ongoing project, with more features left to be implemented. 

Thanks for visiting!

## Features 

- Secure User Authentication for both frontend and backend using BCrypt.
- Users can log in as a demo user.
- Users can see universal photos created by all users.
- Users can upload photos and edit the text associated with the photos only if they are the owner.
- Users can comment directly on the photo's show page and see their comment appear.
